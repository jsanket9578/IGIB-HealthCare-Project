# Key Takeaways:
1. When features available are much more than data points, it doesn't make sense to use a Neural Network based model but instead try eleminating features using liner/non-linear methods.
2. Building weak models in an ensemble for regression may not be ideal, since the only option for computing the output is average of all of them.
